You are designing a ticket pricing program for a movie theater. The program should prompt the user for their age and the type of movie they want to watch (e.g., "regular" or "3D"). Based on the age and movie type, the program should calculate and output the ticket price according to the following rules:
Regular Movie:
Age < 18: $8
Age >= 18: $12
3D Movie:
Age < 18: $10
Age >= 18: $15

import java.util.Scanner;
class TicketPricing
{
public static void main(String[] args)
{
Scanner s=new Scanner(System.in);
int age=s.nextInt();
System.out.println("enter age");
String movietype=s.next()
System.out.println("movie type");

switch(movietype)
{

case "regular"
if(age>=0 && age<18)
{
System.out.println("price is rupees 8");
}
else if(age>=18)
{
System.out.println("price is rupees 12");
}
break;

case "3d"
if(age>=0 && age<18)
{
System.out.println("price is rupees 10");
}
if(age>=18)
{
System.out.println("price is rupees 15");
}
break;
}
}
}
