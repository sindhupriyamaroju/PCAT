Assignment 2:

Recursive Function and Efficiency Analysis - Write a recursive function pseudocode and calculate the nth Fibonacci number
and use Big O notation to analyze its efficiency. Compare this with an iterative approach and discuss the pros and cons 
in terms of space and time complexity.

Recursive approach-
start
function fibonacci(num):
if(num<=1)
print "num"
else
print "fibonacci(num-1)+fibonacci(num-2)"
end

Iterative approach-
start
input a=0,b=1,c=0
print "enter"
for(i=1;i<=n;i++)
   c=a+b
   a=b
   b=c
end for loop
end
