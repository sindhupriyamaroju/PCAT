Create a BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator program. The program should ask the user for their weight (in kilograms) and 
height (in meters). Then, calculate the BMI using the formula BMI = weight / (height * height). Finally, classify the
BMI into categories according to the following criteria:
Underweight: BMI < 18.5
Normal weight: 18.5 <= BMI < 25
Overweight: 25 <= BMI < 30
Obese: BMI >= 30

int weight,height,BMI;
{
printf("enter weight and height");
     BMI = weight / (height * height);
if(BMI<18.5)
  printf("Underweight");
else if(18.5<=BMI<25)
  printf("Normal weight");
else if(25<=BMI<30)
  printf("Overweight");
else if(BMI>=30)
  printf("obese");
}
