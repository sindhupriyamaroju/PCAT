Develop a number guessing game where the program randomly generates a number between 1 and 100. The user has to guess 
the number, and the program provides feedback (higher, lower, or correct) after each guess. Use a loop to allow the 
user to keep guessing until they correctly guess the number.

int i,n,guess;
{
for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
		printf("Enter");
			if(n==guess)
				printf("congrats");
			else if(guess>n)
				printf("guessed greater number");
			else
				printf("guessed lesser number");
}
