Develop a program that checks whether a given string is a palindrome or not. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, 
or other sequence of characters that reads the same backward as forward (e.g., "radar" or "madam"). 
Prompt the user to enter a string, then use a loop to compare characters from the beginning and end of the string to 
determine if it's a palindrome.

int x,y=0,r;
{
printf("enter")
while(x!=0)
{
  r=x%10;
  y=y*10+r;
  x=x/10;
}
printf("x");
}
