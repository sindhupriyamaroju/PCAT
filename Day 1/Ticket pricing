You are designing a ticket pricing program for a movie theater. The program should prompt the user for their age and 
the type of movie they want to watch (e.g., "regular" or "3D"). Based on the age and movie type, the program should
calculate and output the ticket price according to the following rules:
Regular Movie:
Age < 18: $8
Age >= 18: $12
3D Movie:
Age < 18: $10
Age >= 18: $15

int age;
char movie type;
printf("enter movie type")
{
switch(movietype)
case 1:
"regular"
if(age>=0 && age<18)
 printf("price=8");
if(age>=18)
 printf("price=12");
break;
case 2:
"3d"
if(age>=0 && age<18)
 printf("price=10");
if(age>=18)
 printf("price=15");
break;
printf("price is"+price")
}
