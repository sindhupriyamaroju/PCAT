Assignment 3: 

Function Design and Modularization - Create a document that describes the design of two modular functions: 
one that returns the factorial of a number, and another that calculates the nth Fibonacci number.
Include pseudocode and a brief explanation of how modularity in programming helps with code reuse and organization.

start
Declare a variable n and take input
call function named factorial passing value num and print
end

start
Function factorial(int n)
input i,fact=1
print "enter"
for i in range of 1 to n
   fact=fact*i
end for loop
end

start
function fibonacci(int n)
input a=0,b=1,c=0
print "enter"
for i in range of 1 to n
   c=a+b
   a=b
   b=c
end for loop
end
