Write a program that calculates the discount amount for a product based on the following criteria:
If the product price is over $100 and the customer is a premium member, they get a 20% discount.
If the product price is over $100 and the customer is not a premium member, they get a 10% discount.
If the product price is $100 or less, there is no discount.
Prompt the user to input the product price and their premium membership status, then use complex logical expressions 
to calculate and output the discount amount.

int price;
char premium member;
{
printf("enter")
 {
if(price>$100 && premium member)
  printf("you got 20% discount on price");
elseif(price>$100 && not premium member)
  printf("you got 10% discount on price");
else if(price is <= $100)
  printf("you got no discount on price");
  }
}
