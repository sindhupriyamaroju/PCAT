Create a program that determines whether a person is eligible to vote in an election based on the following criteria:
Age must be 18 or above.
Must be a citizen of the country.
Prompt the user to input their age, citizenship status (yes/no), and felony status (yes/no), and then use 
  complex logical expressions to determine and output whether they are eligible to vote.

int age;
char country,felony status;
  {
  printf("enter age and country");
    if(age>=18 && country=India && felony status=yes)
      printf("eligible to vote");
    else
      printf("Not eligible to vote");
    }
