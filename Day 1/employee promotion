Develop a program that assesses whether an employee is eligible for a promotion based on the following criteria:
Must have worked for the company for at least 5 years.
Must have a performance rating of "excellent."
Must have completed at least one advanced training program.
Prompt the user to input their years of service, performance rating, and training status, then use complex logical 
expressions to determine and output whether they are eligible for promotion.

int years of service,advanced training status;
char performance rating;
{
printf("enter");
 {
if(years of service>=5 && performance rating=excellent && advanced training status>=1)
  printf("you are eligible for promotion");
else
   print("you are not eligible for promotion");
 }
}
