Design a program that evaluates whether a person is approved for a credit card based on the following criteria:
Minimum credit score requirement: 700
Maximum debt-to-income ratio: 30%
No recent bankruptcies (within the last 5 years)
Prompt the user to input their credit score, debt amount, income amount, and bankruptcy status, then use complex logical
expressions to determine and output whether they are approved for the credit card

int credit score,debt amount,income amount;
char last 5 years bankruptcy status;
    {
      printf("enter");
      {
if(credit score>=700 && debt amount >=30% && last 5 years bankruptcy status=nill)
      printf("you are approved for credit card");
else
      printf("you are not approved for credit card");
      }
    }
