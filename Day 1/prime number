Create a algorithm/pseudocode that generates and displays all prime numbers within a specified range 
(e.g., between 1 and 100). Use nested loops to iterate through each number in the range and determine if it's a
prime number. A prime number is a whole number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

start
input i,n
print "enter no."
for(i=2;i<n;i++)
   if(n%i==0)
      print "not prime"
      return 0
   else
      print "prime"
end
