Design a program that determines whether a person is eligible for a particular health insurance plan based on the following criteria:
Age must be between 18 and 65.
Must not have any pre-existing medical conditions.
Must not have any recent hospitalizations (within the last 6 months).
Prompt the user to input their age, medical condition status, and hospitalization status, then use complex logical
expressions to determine and output whether they are eligible for the insurance plan.

int age;
char pre-existing medical condition,recent hospitalizations;
{
printf("enter");
 {
if(age >=18 && <=65 && pre-existing medical condition=na && recent hospitalizations=na)
   printf("eligible for the insurance plan");
else
   print("not eligible for the insurance plan");
 }
}
